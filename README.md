# Berry-phase calculation of dimerized spin-chain

The present repository implements various codes to calculate the Berry-phase of a dimerized spin-chain, which serves as a local topological order parameter.

- `hatsugai_berry.py` ~ numerical diagonalization and integral for Berry-phase
- `qc_suzuki.py` ~ quantum algorithm via approximation schemes

More information and explanations can be found in the PDFS: `research-notes.pdf` and `poster.pdf`.
